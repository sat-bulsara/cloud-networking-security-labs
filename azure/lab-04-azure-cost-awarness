# 🟦 LAB 4 — Azure Cost Awareness (Stop vs Delete)

## 💼 Business Framing

In cloud environments, **unexpected cost overruns** are one of the most common operational failures.
This lab demonstrates how engineers must understand *resource lifecycles*, not just whether systems are “running”.

Poor cost hygiene leads to:
- Surprise monthly bills
- Orphaned infrastructure
- Loss of stakeholder trust

This lab intentionally avoids virtual machines to prove that **cost can exist even when nothing appears active**.

---

## 🎯 Lab Goal

Understand what actually costs money in Azure by observing billing behaviour of **non-compute resources** and safely returning to a £0 state.

---

## 🧰 Environment

- **Subscription:** Azure subscription 1
- **Tooling:** Azure CLI (macOS)
- **Region:** UK South
- **Resource Group:** `rg-lab04-cost`
- **Final State:** £0 ongoing cost

---

## 1️⃣ Verify Azure Account Context

Confirmed active subscription and tenant before creating any resources.

## 2️⃣ Create a Cost-Boundary Resource Group

A dedicated resource group was created to act as a **blast radius** for cost and cleanup.

## 3️⃣ Create Billable Resources Without a VM

A **static Public IP** and an **unattached managed disk** were created.
No VM was ever deployed.

**Key observation:**  
Costs begin even though nothing is “running”.

---

## 4️⃣ Partial Cleanup — Delete Only the Public IP

The Public IP was deleted, but the disk was intentionally left behind.

## 5️⃣ Hidden Cost Confirmed

After deleting the Public IP:
- No VM existed
- No Public IP existed
- The disk still existed and remained billable

## 6️⃣ Full Cleanup — Return to £0 State

The entire resource group was deleted, removing all remaining billable resources.

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered

### ❓ Difference between Stop vs Delete?

- **Stop (Deallocate):**
  - VM compute billing stops
  - Disks and networking still bill

- **Delete Resource:**
  - Billing stops only for deleted items

- **Delete Resource Group:**
  - Guaranteed zero ongoing cost

---

### ❓ Why do people get surprise cloud bills?

Because:
- Resources persist after VMs are gone
- Azure bills **existence**, not usage
- Partial cleanup leaves orphaned costs

---

## 🧾 Commands Used & Purpose

```bash
az account show --output table
```
Confirm active subscription and tenant.

```bash
az group create --name rg-lab04-cost --location uksouth
```
Create cost-boundary resource group.

```bash
az resource list --resource-group rg-lab04-cost --output table
```
Inspect all billable resources.

```bash
az network public-ip delete --resource-group rg-lab04-cost --name pip-lab04-cost
```
Delete Public IP only.

```bash
az group delete --name rg-lab04-cost --yes --no-wait
```
Delete everything and return to £0 state.

## ✅ Final Insight

> In Azure, **compute is optional — cost is not**.

Cost awareness is a core cloud engineering skill, not an afterthought.
